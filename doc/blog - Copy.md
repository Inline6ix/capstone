# Introduction

At the heart of immune defense are tiny molecular "flags" called epitopes. These short sequences of amino acids, like "ADVEFCLSL", sit on larger proteins and tell immune cells whether something is a threat. When an immune cell recognizes an epitope on a virus or a cancer cell, it can launch a protective attack.

Being able to reliably identify these epitopes in creating new vaccines and cancer treatments is crucial. Think of epitopes as the precise handshake between the immune system and a threat. Finding the right ones means smarter therapies can be designed. Unlike older treatments like chemotherapy that harm healthy cells, therapies targeting specific epitopes can attack diseases with more accuracy. This promises better results for patients, with fewer debilitating side effects.

This project is all about teaching computers to do this vital identification work. Machine learning models are being built and tested that can look at an amino acid sequence and its properties and decide if it's an epitope or not. By making this process faster and more accurate, the discovery of new vaccine and immunotherapy candidates can be sped up, ultimately leading to more effective and kinder treatments.

# Data

### Dataset

To train these models, the main source is the [Immune Epitope Database](https://www.iedb.org/)(IEDB), the largest public library of knowledge about how the immune system sees and reacts to epitopes on different molecules. It tells which sequences are known to be recognized by T-cells or antibodies.

For this project, the focus has been put on epitopes found on human cancer cells that have been proven in experiments to activate T-cell immune defenses. For each epitope, its unique amino acid sequence and the specific immune system molecule (MHC allele) it interacts with will be used.

Importantly, to train a good model, it doesn't just need to learn what an epitope is; it also needs to learn what it isn't. Many epitope records in the IEDB link to the full protein they come from. These full proteins are used to carefully select sequences that are not currently known epitopes. This provides a set of "yes" (epitope) and "no" (non-epitope) examples.

### Preprocessing

Retrieving the data from IEDB was as simple as doing a search and clicking export. Using the requests python library, the full antigen sequence was downloaded and appended to the epitope dataset. Next, simple formatting was done to standardize the column names. Finally, the epitope dataset was merged with the assays dataset and filtered to include the following columns:

```{python}
#| warning: false

epitopes = pd.read_csv(r'/Users/tariq/Documents/capstone/data/epitope_table_export_1740279588.csv')
assays = pd.read_csv(r'/Users/tariq/Documents/capstone/data/tcell_table_export_1740279970.csv')

def fetch_full_sequence(url):
    if pd.notna(url):  # Check if the URL is not NaN
        url = f'{url}.fasta'
        try:
            response = requests.get(url)
            if response.status_code == 200:
                fasta_io = StringIO(response.text)
                records = list(SeqIO.parse(fasta_io, "fasta"))
                if records:  # Check if there are any records
                    return str(records[0].seq)
                else:
                    print("No records found in the FASTA file.")
        except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
            print(f"Request failed: {e}")
    return None

#epitopes['Full Sequence'] = epitopes['Epitope - Molecule Parent IRI'].apply(fetch_full_sequence)
epitopes = pd.read_csv(r'/Users/tariq/Documents/capstone/data/epitope_full_seq.csv')

# make all column names snake case
epitopes.columns = epitopes.columns.str.lower()
assays.columns = assays.columns.str.lower()

# remove spaces from column names
epitopes.columns = epitopes.columns.str.replace(' ', '')
epitopes.columns = epitopes.columns.str.replace('-', ' ')
epitopes.columns = epitopes.columns.str.replace(' ', '_')

assays.columns = assays.columns.str.replace(' ', '')
assays.columns = assays.columns.str.replace('-', ' ')
assays.columns = assays.columns.str.replace(' ', '_')

epitopes = epitopes.filter(['epitope_name', 'fullsequence'])
assays = assays.filter(['epitope_name', 'epitope_moluculeparent', 'host_name', 'host_mhcpresent', 'assay_method','assay_responsemeasured', 'assay_qualitativemeasurement', 'mhcrestriction_name', 'mhcrestriction_class', 'assayantigen_name'])

# map mhc name and class from the assays dataframe to a new column in the epitopes dataframe based on epitope_name
mhc = assays.filter(['epitope_name', 'mhcrestriction_name', 'mhcrestriction_class'])
mhc = mhc.drop_duplicates(subset=['epitope_name'])
epitopes = epitopes.merge(mhc, on='epitope_name', how='left')

epitopes.head()
```

### MHC Allele Distribution

It's important to understand the distribution of MHC alleles associated with the epitopes in our dataset, as MHC molecules are responsible for presenting these peptides to T-cells. A skewed distribution could influence downstream analysis and potentially bias model performance towards more represented alleles.

```{python mhc_allele_distribution}
#| label: fig-mhc-dist
#| fig-cap: "Top 20 Most Frequent MHC Alleles in Epitope Dataset"

# Assuming 'epitopes' DataFrame with 'mhcrestriction_name' column is available
# from the previous preprocessing cell.

# Count MHC allele frequencies, dropping any NaNs first
mhc_counts = epitopes['mhcrestriction_name'].dropna().value_counts()

# Select top N for visualization
N = 20 # Show the top 20 alleles
top_mhc_counts = mhc_counts.head(N)

# Plotting
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
sns.barplot(x=top_mhc_counts.values, y=top_mhc_counts.index, palette='viridis')
plt.title(f'Top {N} Most Frequent MHC Alleles in Epitope Dataset')
plt.xlabel('Frequency (Number of Epitopes)')
plt.ylabel('MHC Allele')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# Optionally, print some stats for context
# print(f"Total unique alleles found: {len(mhc_counts)}")
# print("Top 5 allele counts:\n", top_mhc_counts.head())

```

The plot reveals a significant skew in the MHC allele distribution within the initial epitope dataset. The allele **HLA-A\*02:01** is vastly overrepresented compared to all others. While other alleles like HLA-A\*24:02 and HLA-A\*03:01 are present, their frequencies are considerably lower. This pronounced skew towards HLA-A\*02:01, while common in immunological datasets due to research focus and population frequencies, is critical to acknowledge. It implies that subsequent analyses and models might be heavily influenced by, or perform best on, peptides presented by this specific allele.

### Negative Sample Generation

```{python negative_sample_generation}
#| eval: false

def generate_negatives(row):
    epitope = row["epitope_name"]
    full_seq = row["fullsequence"]
    mhc = row["mhcrestriction_name"]
    
    # Handle missing or empty sequences
    if pd.isnull(full_seq) or full_seq == "":
        return []
    
    epitope = str(epitope)
    full_seq = str(full_seq)
    ep_len = len(epitope)
    
    negatives = []
    for i in range(len(full_seq) - ep_len + 1):
        window = full_seq[i:i+ep_len]
        if window != epitope:
            negatives.append({"peptide": window, "mhc": mhc})
    return negatives

# Apply the function to each row
negatives = pd.DataFrame()
negatives['negatives'] = epitopes.apply(generate_negatives, axis=1)
negatives = negatives[["negatives"]].explode("negatives").reset_index(drop=True)
negatives.dropna(subset=["negatives"], inplace=True)


# Remove duplicates
print(f"Shape before removing duplicates: {negatives.shape}")
negatives = negatives.drop_duplicates(subset=['negatives'])
print(f"Shape after removing duplicates: {negatives.shape}")

# Check for any remaining NaN values
print(f"Number of NaN values in negatives: {negatives['negatives'].isna().sum()}")

# Extract peptide and mhc into separate columns
negatives['peptide'] = negatives['negatives'].apply(lambda x: x['peptide'])
negatives['mhc'] = negatives['negatives'].apply(lambda x: x['mhc'])
```

Although the IEDB database provided a substantial amount of epitopes, in order draw visual comparisons and create models to classify epitopes, samples of non-epitope peptides are needed. These can be generated by shuffling and sampling amino acid sequences from the full antigen sequences of the epitopes, ensuring that the sampled sequences did not overlap with the epitope sequences.

There are pros and cons to this methodology. As opposed to generating completely random sequences of amino acids â€” sampling from larger sequences allows for natural patterns and physiochemical motifs to be retained. That is not to say the performance of statistical modeling or qualitative analysis will be better. Random sequences are more likely to be highly irregular, or even biologically implausible. Sampling from the full antigen sequences eliminates this potential bias.

Conversely, it is possible for a randomly sampled peptide to be an epitope that has not been tested yet, or simply isn't in the subset of data used for this analysis â€” resulting in an increase in the number of false negatives in our data.

The protein analysis tool from the BioPython package allows for some quick feature engineering on most given peptides. For this analysis, the relevant features would be hydrophobicity, molecular weight, aromaticity, isoelectric point, instability, and the charge at pH7. Publications on epitope classification hold binding affinity â€” the ability for a peptide to bind to the body's MHC complex â€” to be a strong preditctor. The BioPython package does not come with any functionality for binding affinity prediction but IEDB provides a tool called **netMHCpan**, which is the leading binding affinity prediction algorithm.

The IEDB website offers a GUI for using netMHCpan to predict binding affinities. However, it is only possible to run predictions on 100 peptides at a time and this analysis is examining many more than that. NetMHCpan can be downloaded and installed as a command line tool allowing more flexibility using python. Given an amino acid sequence and an MHC allele specification, netMHCpan returns a binding affinity score. This score ranges from 0 to 1, where higher values indicate a stronger likelihood of binding.

Subsequent analysis filters for 9-mer peptides, a common length for MHC Class I epitopes, for which binding prediction tools like netMHCpan are well-suited. After feature engineering, we have:

```{python}
epitopes = pd.read_csv("/Users/tariq/Documents/capstone/data/ninemer_epitopes.csv")
epitopes = epitopes.drop(columns=['fullsequence', 'mhcrestriction_name', 'mhcrestriction_class', 'epitope_length'])
epitopes = epitopes.rename(columns={'epitope_name': 'peptide', 'epitope_avg_hydro': 'peptide_avg_hydro'})
epitopes_BA_pred = pd.read_csv("/Users/tariq/Documents/capstone/data/ninemer_epitopes_BA_pred.csv")

negatives = pd.read_csv("/Users/tariq/Documents/capstone/data/ninemer_negatives_trimmed.csv")
negatives = negatives.drop(columns=['mhc', 'peptide_length'])
negatives = negatives.rename(columns={'peptide': 'peptide'})
negatives = negatives.drop_duplicates(subset=['peptide'])
negatives_BA_pred = pd.read_csv("/Users/tariq/Documents/capstone/data/ninemer_negatives_trimmed_BA_pred.csv")
negatives_BA_pred = negatives_BA_pred.drop_duplicates(subset=['peptide'])

# Merge the 'Score_BA' column from epitopes_BA_pred into the epitopes dataframe
epitopes = pd.merge(epitopes, epitopes_BA_pred[['peptide', 'Score_BA']], on='peptide', how='left')

negatives = pd.merge(negatives, negatives_BA_pred[['peptide', 'Score_BA']], on='peptide', how='left')

epitopes.head()
```

# What Distinguishes an epitope from any other peptide?

### Statistical Comparison

```{python}
#| label: fig-stat-compare
#| fig-cap: "Density Plot Comparison of Numeric Features between Epitopes and Negatives"

# Compare numeric features between epitopes and negatives datasets
numeric_features = ['peptide_avg_hydro', 'molecular_weight', 'aromaticity', 
                    'isoelectric_point', 'instability', 'charge_at_pH7', 'Score_BA']

# Create a figure with subplots for each numeric feature
fig, axes = plt.subplots(len(numeric_features), 1, figsize=(12, 5*len(numeric_features)))
#fig.tight_layout(pad=5.0)

# Plot density plots for each feature
for i, feature in enumerate(numeric_features):
    ax = axes[i]
    
    # Create density plot for Epitopes
    sns.kdeplot(epitopes[feature].dropna(), ax=ax, label='Epitopes', fill=True)
    
    # Create density plot for Negatives
    sns.kdeplot(negatives[feature].dropna(), ax=ax, label='Negatives', fill=True)
    
    # Add feature statistics
    epitope_mean = epitopes[feature].mean()
    negative_mean = negatives[feature].mean()
    
    ax.set_title(f'{feature} Density Plot Comparison')
    ax.text(0.02, 0.95, f'Epitopes mean: {epitope_mean:.4f}', transform=ax.transAxes)
    ax.text(0.02, 0.90, f'Negatives mean: {negative_mean:.4f}', transform=ax.transAxes)
    ax.legend()
    
    # Add p-value from t-test
    from scipy import stats
    t_stat, p_value = stats.ttest_ind(
        epitopes[feature].dropna(), 
        negatives[feature].dropna(),
        equal_var=False  # Welch's t-test (doesn't assume equal variances)
    )
    #ax.text(0.02, 0.85, f'p-value: {p_value:.4e}', transform=ax.transAxes)

#plt.suptitle('Comparison of Numeric Features Between Epitopes and Negatives', fontsize=16)
plt.show()
```

A boxplot comparison of the numerical variables reveals hardly significant differences between the epitope and non-epitope peptides. The clear outlier being the predicted binding affinity score.

```{python}
#| label: fig-ba-hist
#| fig-cap: "Normalized Histogram of Binding Affinity Scores"

# plot Score_BA for epitopes and negatives overlaid on the same plot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))

# Use density instead of raw counts to normalize the histograms
plt.hist(epitopes['Score_BA'], bins=20, alpha=0.5, color='blue', edgecolor='black', 
         label='Epitopes', density=True)
plt.hist(negatives['Score_BA'], bins=20, alpha=0.5, color='red', edgecolor='black', 
         label='Negatives', density=True)

# Alternative approach: use log scale for y-axis
plt.yscale('log')

plt.xlabel('Binding Affinity')
plt.ylabel('Density (log scale)')
plt.title('Normalized Histogram of Binding Affinity for Epitopes vs Negatives')
plt.legend(prop={'size': 14})  # Increased legend font size
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

Upon further inspection of the difference in predicted binding affinity score, we see the non-epitope peptides exhibit a right-skewed distribution with a mean of 0.07, and the epitopes show a broad, moderate-variance spread with a much higher mean of 0.56.

### Sequence Motifs

While the predicted binding affinity score is a strong predictor of epitope classification, it is not the only feature that distinguishes an epitope from a non-epitope. To further understand the differences between the two classes, we can look for patterns in the amino acid sequences. 

One way to explore these patterns is to examine the frequency of short amino acid motifs, such as tripeptides (sequences of three amino acids). By comparing the most frequent tripeptides in known epitopes versus non-epitope sequences, we might identify motifs that are enriched in one class or the other.

```{python tripeptide_frequency_analysis}

```

These plots show the most common tripeptide sequences found within the epitope and non-epitope datasets. Comparing these can help identify if certain short amino acid patterns are more prevalent in one group over the other, potentially hinting at structural or functional differences recognized by the immune system or affecting MHC binding.

Interpreting the tripeptide frequency plots:

*   **Epitopes:** The tripeptide `LLL` (three Leucines) is strikingly dominant, with Leucine-rich motifs (e.g., `SLL`, `LSL`) being highly prevalent.
*   **Non-Epitopes:** `SSS` (three Serines) is the most frequent. While `LLL` is also common, this group shows more diversity with prominent Serine, Proline (`PPP`), and Glycine-based motifs (e.g., `GGS`).
*   **Key Takeaway:** The most frequent tripeptides differ significantly between epitopes and non-epitopes. Epitopes favor Leucine-heavy motifs, while non-epitopes have a broader range with `SSS` leading. This suggests that these short sequence patterns contribute to distinguishing the two classes, likely influencing factors such as MHC binding.

Another powerful way to visualize conserved patterns in a set of sequences is by generating sequence logos. A sequence logo provides a graphical representation of an amino acid (or nucleotide) multiple sequence alignment. Each position in the logo consists of a stack of symbols, where the height of each symbol indicates its frequency at that position, and the total height of the stack reflects the information content or conservation at that position.

These sequence logos visually represent the amino acid preferences at each of the 9 positions for epitopes (top) and non-epitopes (bottom). Larger letters indicate a higher frequency of that amino acid at that specific position. The overall height of the stack of letters at a position indicates the degree of conservation at that position.

Interpreting the sequence logos:

*   **Epitope Logo (Top):** While showing variability, there's a noticeable preference for Leucine (`L`, black) at the C-terminal position (position 8) and also a tendency for `L` at position 1. Other positions show a mix of amino acids with generally lower conservation, though residues like Serine (`S`, green), Lysine (`K`, blue), and Valine (`V`, black) appear at various spots.
*   **Non-Epitope Logo (Bottom):** This logo generally shows even more diversity (lower, more uniform stacks) across all positions. While Leucine (`L`) and Serine (`S`) are common, no single amino acid strongly dominates at most positions. The C-terminal preference for `L` seen in epitopes is less pronounced here.
*   **Key Comparison:** Epitopes exhibit a clearer, albeit modest, preference for Leucine at the C-terminus (position 8). Non-epitopes display greater sequence variation across all positions. This aligns with the aggregated saliency maps that highlighted position 8 as important, particularly for epitopes, and suggests that while both classes are diverse, epitopes might have slightly stronger anchor preferences recognizable in a logo format.

# Can we predict?

### Model Selection: A Baseline with State-of-the-Art Binding Prediction

To establish a robust baseline, we first develop a Random Forest classifier. This model incorporates a crucial feature: predicted binding affinity scores (`Score_BA`) derived from `netMHCpan`, a state-of-the-art algorithm for MHC binding prediction. By including this, our baseline leverages existing sophisticated domain knowledge. The full feature set includes:

-   Average Hydrophobicity
-   Molecular Weight
-   Aromaticity
-   Isoelectric Point
-   Instability
-   Charge at pH7

Performace will be evaluated based on accuracy, precision, and recall.

### Preprocessing

Prior to training, labels are assigned to the epitopes and non-epitopes as 1 or 0 respectively. The two samples are then concatenated, scaled, and shuffled. Finally, the data is split into training and testing sets with an 80/20 ratio.

```{python}
#| label: fig-cm-rf
#| fig-cap: "Confusion Matrix for Random Forest with Binding Affinity"

# Add label column to epitopes dataframe (positive class = 1)
epitopes['label'] = 1

# Add label column to negatives dataframe (negative class = 0)
negatives['label'] = 0

# Combine the positive and negative examples
combined_data = pd.concat([epitopes, negatives], ignore_index=True)

# Shuffle the combined dataset
combined_data = combined_data.sample(frac=1, random_state=42).reset_index(drop=True)

# Define features and target
X = combined_data.drop(columns=['peptide', 'label'])
y = combined_data['label']

# Identify numerical columns to scale (exclude one-hot encoded amino acid columns)
numerical_cols = ['peptide_avg_hydro', 'molecular_weight', 'aromaticity', 'isoelectric_point', 'instability']

# Split the data into training and testing sets (80% train, 20% test)
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42, stratify=y
)

# Scale numerical features using StandardScaler
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_train[numerical_cols] = scaler.fit_transform(X_train[numerical_cols])
X_test[numerical_cols] = scaler.transform(X_test[numerical_cols])

# Print the shapes to verify the split
print(f"Training set: {X_train.shape[0]} samples")
print(f"Testing set: {X_test.shape[0]} samples")
print(f"Positive samples in training: {sum(y_train == 1)}")
print(f"Negative samples in training: {sum(y_train == 0)}")
print(f"Positive samples in testing: {sum(y_test == 1)}")
print(f"Negative samples in testing: {sum(y_test == 0)}")
```

### Training + Evaluation

The random forest classifier is fit to the training data and evaluated on the testing data.

```{python}
#| label: fig-cm-rf-ba
#| fig-cap: "Confusion Matrix for Random Forest with Binding Affinity"

# Initialize the Random Forest Classifier
rf_model = RandomForestClassifier(
    n_estimators=100,  # Number of trees
    max_depth=None,    # Maximum depth of trees
    min_samples_split=2,
    min_samples_leaf=1,
    random_state=42
)

# Train the model
rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = rf_model.predict(X_test)
y_pred_proba = rf_model.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]  # Probability estimates for positive class

# Confusion Matrix
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)

# Plot Confusion Matrix
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='Blues', 
            xticklabels=['Predicted Negative', 'Predicted Positive'], 
            yticklabels=['Actual Negative', 'Actual Positive'])
plt.xlabel('Predicted Label')
plt.ylabel('True Label')
plt.title('Confusion Matrix - Random Forest')
plt.show()

# Evaluate the model
print("\nRandom Forest Model Classification Report:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

The results show strong performance from the random forest classifier, with an overall accuracy of 91% and recall of 75% for the positive class. This strong performance is substantially aided by its reliance on the powerful `Score_BA` predictor from `netMHCpan`.

```{python}
#| label: Fig-1
#| fig-cap: "Feature Importance for Random Forest with Binding Affinity"

# Feature importance
feature_importance = pd.DataFrame({
    'Feature': X_train.columns,
    'Importance': rf_model.feature_importances_
})
feature_importance = feature_importance.sort_values('Importance', ascending=True)

# Plot top 15 features
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
top_features = feature_importance.head(15)
plt.barh(np.arange(len(top_features)), top_features['Importance'], align='center')
plt.yticks(np.arange(len(top_features)), top_features['Feature'])
plt.xlabel('Importance')
plt.title('Feature Importance - Random Forest')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### Quantifying the Impact of Binding Affinity Prediction

To underscore the significant contribution of the `netMHCpan`-derived binding affinity, we next evaluate the Random Forest model *without* the `Score_BA` feature. This helps quantify the performance drop when relying solely on other physiochemical properties without this advanced binding prediction.

```{python}
#| label: fig-cm-rf-noba
#| fig-cap: "Confusion Matrix for Random Forest without Binding Affinity"

# drop the Score_BA column
X_train = X_train.drop(columns=['Score_BA'])
X_test = X_test.drop(columns=['Score_BA'])

# Initialize the Random Forest Classifier
rf_model = RandomForestClassifier(
    n_estimators=100,  # Number of trees
    max_depth=None,    # Maximum depth of trees
    min_samples_split=2,
    min_samples_leaf=1,
    random_state=42
)

# Train the model
rf_model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = rf_model.predict(X_test)
y_pred_proba = rf_model.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]  # Probability estimates for positive class

# Confusion Matrix
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)

# Plot Confusion Matrix
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='Blues', 
            xticklabels=['Predicted Negative', 'Predicted Positive'], 
            yticklabels=['Actual Negative', 'Actual Positive'])
plt.xlabel('Predicted Label')
plt.ylabel('True Label')
plt.title('Confusion Matrix - Random Forest')
plt.show()

# Evaluate the model
print("\nClassification Report:")
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```

The accuracy only drops from 91% to 79%. However, this is misleading when considering the class imbalance of the data. The ratio of negative samples to positive is roughly 4:1, respectively. So, predicting the majority class â€” non-epitope â€” almost everytime would result in the majority of the testing data being correctly predicted and labeled.

A better performance metric to compare between models would be the model's recall rate on the positive class. How many of the epitopes in the testing data were correctly predicted and labeled? The same model, when predicted binding affinity was included as a predictor, produced a 74% recall rate while the current model has a much lower 18% recall rate. This dramatic drop in recall for epitopes clearly demonstrates the Random Forest model's heavy dependence on the `netMHCpan` binding affinity scores for identifying true positives.

```{python}
#| label: Fig-2
#| fig-cap: "Feature Importance for Random Forest without Binding Affinity"

# Feature importance
feature_importance = pd.DataFrame({
    'Feature': X_train.columns,
    'Importance': rf_model.feature_importances_
})
feature_importance = feature_importance.sort_values('Importance', ascending=True)

# Plot top 15 features
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
top_features = feature_importance.head(15)
plt.barh(np.arange(len(top_features)), top_features['Importance'], align='center')
plt.yticks(np.arange(len(top_features)), top_features['Feature'])
plt.xlabel('Importance')
plt.title('Feature Importance - Random Forest')
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### A Different Approach: Learning Directly from Sequence with CNNs

Given the Random Forest model's significant reliance on pre-computed binding affinity from `netMHCpan` (a powerful, but distinct, predictive step), we explore an alternative strategy: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The key value of the CNN in this context is its ability to learn predictive patterns *directly from the raw amino acid sequences themselves*. Unlike the RF model which uses engineered features and external predictions like `Score_BA`, the CNN can potentially uncover complex sequence motifs, positional dependencies, and other subtle features relevant to epitope classification that may not be fully captured by binding affinity predictions alone. This approach allows the model to discover novel, sequence-intrinsic features without explicit feature engineering or reliance on separate binding prediction tools, offering a complementary perspective on what defines an epitope.

To start, the data will be filtered to only include the amino acid sequence and respective label.
```{python data_prep}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd # Assuming epitopes and negatives are pandas DataFrames
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras.models import Model
from tensorflow.keras.layers import (
    Conv1D, MaxPooling1D, Flatten, Dense, Dropout, Input, BatchNormalization
)
from tensorflow.keras.callbacks import EarlyStopping, ModelCheckpoint, ReduceLROnPlateau
from tensorflow.keras.regularizers import l2
from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam
from tensorflow.keras import metrics
from sklearn.metrics import (
    classification_report, confusion_matrix, roc_curve, auc,
    precision_recall_curve, average_precision_score, accuracy_score
)
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Filter and combine
epitopes_filtered = epitopes[['peptide', 'label']].copy()
epitopes_filtered.rename(columns={'peptide': 'sequence'}, inplace=True)
negatives_filtered = negatives[['peptide', 'label']].copy()
negatives_filtered.rename(columns={'peptide': 'sequence'}, inplace=True)

combined_data = pd.concat([epitopes_filtered, negatives_filtered], ignore_index=True)

# Shuffle the validated data
combined_data = combined_data.sample(frac=1, random_state=42).reset_index(drop=True)
combined_data.head()
```

To train a neural network, the sequence must be represented in a numerical format. Assigning each amino acid a unique integer value up to 20, the sequences are converted to a list of integers. Then, the resulting integer sequences are one-hot encoded into a 3-dimensional arrary of shape (25628, 9, 20). 25,628 peptides, 9 amino acids in each peptide, 20 unique amino acids. The data is split into training, validation, and testing sets with a 70/15/15 ratio.

```{python sequence_encoding}

# Extract sequences
all_sequences = combined_data['sequence'].tolist()

# Find unique characters (amino acids) across all sequences
unique_chars = sorted(list(set("".join(all_sequences))))

# Map characters to indices starting from 0 (no padding index needed)
char_to_index = {char: i for i, char in enumerate(unique_chars)}
index_to_char = {i: char for i, char in enumerate(unique_chars)}

num_chars = len(unique_chars) # Vocabulary size is just the number of unique chars

# Convert sequences to integer sequences
int_sequences = []
for seq in all_sequences:
     int_seq = [char_to_index[char] for char in seq]
     int_sequences.append(int_seq)

# One-hot encode the integer sequences
# Shape: (num_samples, sequence_length, num_unique_chars)
# Assuming all sequences have length 9 as implied by the shape (9, num_chars)
sequence_length = 9 # Explicitly define sequence length
X_onehot = np.zeros((len(int_sequences), sequence_length, num_chars), dtype=np.float32)

for i, seq in enumerate(int_sequences):
    # Ensure sequence length matches expected length before encoding
    if len(seq) == sequence_length:
        for j, char_idx in enumerate(seq): # j is position (0-8), char_idx is the integer index of the amino acid
            X_onehot[i, j, char_idx] = 1.0
    else:
        print(f"Warning: Sequence at index {i} has length {len(seq)}, expected {sequence_length}. Skipping.")

y = combined_data['label'].values

# --- Data Splitting (70/15/15) ---
print("--- Data Splitting ---")
# Split into temp (85%) and test (15%)
X_temp, X_test, y_temp, y_test = train_test_split(
    X_onehot, y, test_size=0.15, random_state=42, stratify=y
)
# Split temp into train (70% of total) and validation (15% of total)
val_split_ratio = 0.15 / 0.85 # Calculate split ratio for validation set
X_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(
    X_temp, y_temp, test_size=val_split_ratio, random_state=42, stratify=y_temp
)

print(f"Training set: {X_train.shape}")
print(f"Validation set: {X_val.shape}")
print(f"Testing set: {X_test.shape}")
print("-" * 30)
```

A basic CNN model is defined. The model takes one-hot encoded sequences as input and passes them through three blocks of 1D Convolution, BatchNormalization, and MaxPooling1D layers with increasing filter counts (64, 128, 256) and L2 regularization to extract features. After flattening the output, it goes through two fully connected (Dense) blocks, each with BatchNormalization, Dropout (0.5 and 0.4), L2 regularization, and ReLU activation, reducing dimensionality (256 then 128 units). The final Dense layer uses a softmax activation to output probabilities for each class. The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer, sparse_categorical_crossentropy loss, and tracks accuracy as a metric, finally returning the compiled model after being instantiated with the specific input shape.

```{python model_definition}
def create_cnn_model(input_shape, num_classes=2):
    """Creates and compiles the CNN model."""
    inputs = Input(shape=input_shape)
    x = Conv1D(64, kernel_size=8, activation='relu', padding='same', kernel_regularizer=l2(0.001))(inputs)
    x = BatchNormalization()(x)
    x = MaxPooling1D(pool_size=2, padding='same')(x)

    x = Conv1D(128, kernel_size=8, activation='relu', padding='same', kernel_regularizer=l2(0.001))(x)
    x = BatchNormalization()(x)
    x = MaxPooling1D(pool_size=2, padding='same')(x)

    x = Conv1D(256, kernel_size=8, activation='relu', padding='same', kernel_regularizer=l2(0.001))(x)
    x = BatchNormalization()(x)

    x = Flatten()(x)

    x = Dense(256, activation='relu', kernel_regularizer=l2(0.001))(x)
    x = BatchNormalization()(x)
    x = Dropout(0.5)(x)
    x = Dense(128, activation='relu', kernel_regularizer=l2(0.001))(x)
    x = BatchNormalization()(x)
    x = Dropout(0.4)(x)

    outputs = Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')(x)

    model = Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)

    optimizer = Adam(learning_rate=0.001)
    model.compile(optimizer=optimizer,
                  loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
                  metrics=['accuracy'])
    return model

input_shape = (9, num_chars)
model = create_cnn_model(input_shape)
```


Before training the model, class weights are calculated to handle the data imbalance, effectively telling the model to "pay more attention" to samples from the minority class.

```{python class-weights_and_training}

The Convolutional Neural Network produced a reasonable overall accuracy of 82%, primarily driven by its strong ability to correctly identify the majority, non-epitopes, with high precision and recall. However, its performance on the minority class, epitopes, was mixed; while managing to recall 65% of true epitopes, its precision was significantly lower at 56%, indicating that nearly half of its positive predictions were false positives.

The Convolutional Neural Network significantly outperforms the Random Forest classifier while relying only on the sequence data, and no additional features. The RF struggles with identifying the actual epitopes, shown by the low recall for Class 1, whereas the CNN, while still challenged with precision for Class 1, provides a better balance and significantly higher recall for the positive class, making it the more effective model in this comparison.

### CNN Saliency Maps

To better understand what the CNN model learned, we can generate saliency maps. A saliency map highlights which input features (amino acids at specific positions) were most influential in the model's decision for a given input sample. This is done by calculating the gradient of the model's output with respect to the input features.

The following plots examine a single sample sequence, `AASCFTASV`, which the model misclassified. The true label is Non-epitope (Class 0), but the model predicted it as an Epitope (Class 1) with high confidence. The first map shows which features drove the incorrect "Epitope" prediction, and the second map shows which features would have been important for the correct "Non-epitope" classification.

```{python cnn_saliency_map}

For this specific misclassified sample (`AASCFTASV`):

*   The model's incorrect "Epitope" prediction was strongly influenced by the `C` at position 3, `A` at position 6, and `V` at position 8.

*   Interestingly, for the correct "Non-epitope" classification, the `C` at position 3 and `V` at position 8 also show high importance.

This suggests these positions are critical decision points for the model for this sequence, potentially with conflicting signals leading to the misclassification.

### Aggregated Saliency Maps

To get a more general understanding of feature importance across the dataset, we can compute average saliency maps for different classes of samples. Below, we calculate and plot the average saliency map for true epitopes and true non-epitopes in the test set. The saliency is calculated with respect to the **true class output** for each sample. This helps to reveal general patterns the model has learned for distinguishing the two classes.

Interpreting the aggregated saliency maps:

*   **Dominance of the C-terminus (Position 8):** For both true epitopes and true non-epitopes, the amino acid at position 8 (the C-terminal end) shows by far the highest average saliency. This indicates the model heavily relies on the identity of this final residue to make its classification.

*   **Importance of Position 1 for Non-Epitopes:** For true non-epitopes, the amino acid at position 1 (the second residue) also shows notably high average saliency, suggesting its importance in identifying a sequence as *not* an epitope.

*   **General Pattern:** The model appears to have learned that the C-terminal residue is a primary determinant, with other positions like position 1 (especially for non-epitopes) playing secondary, but still significant, roles.

# Conclusion

This project aimed to develop and evaluate computational models for classifying cancer T-cell epitopes, a necessary task for advancing personalized cancer treatment. By utilizing data from the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) and employing feature engineering and machine learning techniques, we explored factors differentiating epitopes from non-epitope peptides derived from the same source proteins.

A Random Forest model incorporating predicted binding affinity scores from `netMHCpan` achieved high overall performance and reasonable recall for identifying true epitopes. However, removing this binding affinity feature caused a dramatic drop in the model's ability to identify epitopes, indicating that standard physicochemical features alone, while descriptive, were insufficient for robust classification in this context.

Significantly, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on one-hot encoded peptide sequences, without relying on external binding predictors or engineered features, demonstrated superior performance compared to the feature-based Random Forest without binding affinity. The CNN achieved balanced performance with better recall for the epitope class. This demonstrates the potential of deep learning models to capture patterns directly from sequence data.
